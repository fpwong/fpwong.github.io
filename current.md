## Cooperative Hack And Slash

Best described as a cross between Dark Souls and Alienswarm. I wanted the weighty combat focusing on timing which you see in Dark Souls and many recent melee-oriented action games. 

Some gifs of my progress can be found at my twitter ([@funcpwong](https://twitter.com/funcpwong)), clicking images below will take you to the related youtube video.

The other side features the progression and cooperativeness of games such as Alienswarm, Payday and Left 4 Dead.

The game will be level-based. You will unlock weapon, perks and skills that you can choose before you start the level.

Players will have to work together, figure out which combination is best for which level (especially important for the harder difficulties).

An important decision is whether players have classes, so an archer, mage or warrior and I will most likely be deciding that by the start of 2018.
