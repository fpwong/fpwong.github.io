Best described as a cross between Dark Souls and Alienswarm.

Gameplay focuses on weighty combat focusing on dodging attacks and counter attacking. An important part of the combat is knocking the enemy into the air, continuous attacks will keep enemies in the air rendering them powerless.

The game will be level-based. Players will unlock weapons, perks and skills that they can choose before starting the level.

Players have to figure out which combination of perks and skills work together and decide which player will take the role of tank, dps or utility. This will be especially important for completing harder difficulties.
